# React Native Multitimer App

This is a basic multitimer application created with React Native. It allows the user to create timer groups for various tasks that require simultaneously running timers. For example, cooking multiple dishes at once.

This repository exists as a way for me to experiment and update my original app design. The original Github classroom repo this project is based off of does not allow forking. View the original Github Classroom project and commits here: https://github.com/bsu-cs-jb/project-02-North-Kaster
